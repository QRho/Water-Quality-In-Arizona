### CARBON:

Carbon, is it bad?
No, it adds nothing to water and doesn't leave an aftertaste. 

TOC = Total Organic carbon. This is the amount of carbon found in organic compound and is a non-specific indicator of water quality. Should not go over 25 mg/L, most lakes are between 2-10 mg/L.

DOC = Dissolved organic carbon. This covers a fraction of what total organic carbon can pass through a filter. Too much DOC in water can lead to an increase in bacteria growth. Should not go over 5 mg/L.

UVA = Ultraviolet absorbance. This is a water quality test paramerter that uses UV rays to see the amount of carbon per cm (cm-1).

SUVA = Specific Ultraviolet Absorbance. It is the absorbance of UV light in a water sample at a specified wavelength. It is normalized for DOC concentration. Should not exceed 2.0 L/mg-m.

### FIELD MEASUREMENTS:

pH is affected by temperature, the higher the temperature, the pH drops.

A safe pH level for drinking water is between 6 and 8.5. Pure water has a pH level of 7.


High pH water tastes like baking soda and leaves residue on fixtures. The water is also hard. It doesn't cause any health risks, but can be hard to lather with soap, can cause skin problems, and is more difficult to heat up.
Low pH water can have a bitter taste and may cause corrosion on fixtures. It can be unsafe to drink because it can be contaminated with pollutants.

You may need to test the pH of your water if you notice a discoloration on your faucets and pipes (can be a rusty red, white or blue color).
